# Summary
My idea is to build a top down arena shooter, with two players playing agents each other. I want the players to have there own teams in form of AI bots, and possibility of having more then two teams, so some teams will be controlled entirely by AI bots. Each play will be dynamic having many players/bots in the arena. I am not sure of a name yet, I will update that later! Name of the game will be Arena Shooter.

# Gameplay
The objective is to capture as much area of the arena as posable. When having more area captured your teams score will rise faster. Which ever team reaches the goal points, they will win the play. This encourages the players to attack other teams, and to constantly move to other parts of the arena. At random places of the arena you can pick up ammunition as you will not have infinite ammo, same thing goes for bots, they will obey by the same rules as players. The players/bots health will automatically regenerate after a while, so if you take a lot of damage you must seek cover until the health is regenerated. 

# Mechanics
Each team will be identified by a given color. The bots will spawn with random weapons (maybe there will be classes). The weapons will have different stats like recoil, fire rate, damage, range, knock back and ammunition capacity. So the player will have to get familiar with different weapons and use them for there own play style.

# Milestones
1. My first milestone is to create a main menu, and for players to be able to create a play. They get spawned in a arena and they can move around.
2. Second milestone is to introduce weapons and there mechanics, and for players to be able to shoot, regenerate ammunition, take damage and regenerate damage. Here I want to tweak the feel of the movement and the shooting mechanics so they feel right.
3. I want to add AI bots, and a mechanic to capture different areas of the arena.
